In this package, I will test various of simple functions. Such as:
- [x] Add(int64, int64) int64, with predicted output
- [ ] Add(int64, int64) int64, with unpredicted output (overflow on runtime)
- [x] AddUnsigned(uint64, uint64) uint64, with predicted output
- [ ] AddUnsigned(uint64, uint64) uint64, unpredicted output (overflow on runtime)

The test file of this function will be placed under the same namespace.
